Ruby Recap
==========

This weekend challenge involved revisiting the basics of Ruby. There are 41 questions in the `lib/questions.rb` file, and an accompanying `spec/questions_spec.rb` file that tests the implementation of the answers provided.  To run a single example, change `it` to `fit` within the spec file and then run `$ rspec questions_spec.rb --tag focus` in the command line.
